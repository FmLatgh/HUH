        <p id="paragraph1">Hi, my name is Stan van Groenendaal. I'm 19, and study over at SiNTLUCAS Eindhoven for software development.
        My current goal is to become a software developer/game developer or atleast try to find the balance in that. As others describe me, I'm very self-conscious, ambitious and helpful.
        I live with my mum and younger brother somewhere in Tilburg, where I have my own room where all of this inspiration comes from! In freetime, I like to go bouldering with my fellow students as freetime activity.
        My other hobbies consist of hosting gamenights, private servers on games as Space Station 13, writing, roleplaying and bouldering.
        I like to think I'm different from other people. I have my own approach to projects, whether that's just straight-on or with help from others is different everytime.
        </p>
    <br>
        <p id="paragraph2">Over the time, I have been building up skills which both help me communicate with others and to create something new.
        You can find my style of how I like to work over on my projects page, but for now I would like to explain what I achieve with or without others.
        I think I have enough knowledge to code a game in C#, with alot of the keywords still being new to me, though. I do have more knowledge on objects, how to create
        roguelikes which are entirely text-based (Minus One) and more abstract development. Furthermore, I am a writer of stories. I have a large collection of exerpts or pilots I have written in my freetime as a way to use my creativity.
            People say I'm also pretty good at leading stuff. Which all directly originate from my hobbies. I like to think I'm a good leader, but I'm not sure myself.</p>
